## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Make
- Go 1.24+
- Python 3.13+
- **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** (required for Python development)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for component- and integration tests)
- Kubectl, Helm, Kind (for local deployment and e2e tests)

**Install Go 1.24+**:

On macOS/Linux:
```bash
bash < <(curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moovweb/gvm/master/binscripts/gvm-installer)
gvm install go1.24
gvm use go1.24 --default
```

**Configure Go binary PATH**:

After installing Go, ensure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your PATH for Go tools (golangci-lint, goimports):

```bash
# Add to your shell profile (~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, or ~/.profile)
export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"

# Reload your shell or source the profile
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
```

Verify the setup:
```bash
go version  # Should show go1.24+
go env GOPATH  # Should show your GOPATH (e.g., /Users/username/go)
echo $PATH | grep "$(go env GOPATH)/bin"  # Should include GOPATH/bin
```

**Install uv**:
```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows (not tested yet)
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### Installing Development Dependencies

```bash
make setup
```
**Note**: All Python commands are executed via `uv` to ensure consistent dependency management.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests (Go + Python)
make test-unit

# Run unit tests for specific components
make -C src/asya-sidecar test-unit    # Go sidecar unit tests only
make -C src/asya-gateway test-unit    # Go gateway unit tests only
make -C src/asya-runtime test-unit    # Python runtime unit tests only

# Run all integration tests (requires Docker Compose)
make test-integration

# Run specific integration test suites
make -C testing/integration/sidecar-runtime test   # Sidecar ↔ Runtime
make -C testing/integration/gateway-actors test    # Gateway ↔ Actors

# Run all tests (unit + integration)
make test

# Clean up integration test Docker resources
make clean-integration
```

### Code Coverage

The project uses **octocov** for code coverage reporting - a fully open-source solution that runs in GitHub Actions without external services.

**Quick Coverage Check:**
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage and display summary (recommended)
make cov

# Run coverage for specific components
make -C src/asya-sidecar cov-unit   # Sidecar (Go)
make -C src/asya-gateway cov-unit   # Gateway (Go)
make -C src/asya-operator cov-unit  # Operator (Go)
make -C src/asya-runtime cov-unit   # Runtime (Python)
make -C src/asya-crew cov-unit      # System actors (Python)
```

The `make cov` command:
- Runs all tests with coverage enabled
- Displays a clean summary for each component
- Prevents coverage output from getting lost in verbose test logs
- Generates HTML reports for detailed analysis

**Local Development:**
- Use `make cov` to see coverage summaries
- Tests display coverage stats in the terminal
- No configuration needed

**CI/Pull Requests:**
- Coverage reports are automatically posted as PR comments
- Coverage history is tracked in the `gh-pages` branch
- Uses only `GITHUB_TOKEN` (no third-party API keys needed)

**Viewing detailed coverage reports:**
```bash
# After running 'make cov', HTML reports are generated:
# - Python: open src/asya-runtime/htmlcov/index.html
# - Go: go tool cover -html=src/asya-sidecar/coverage.out
```

**Coverage files:**
- Go: `coverage.out`, `coverage-integration.out`
- Python: `coverage.xml` (Cobertura format), `htmlcov/` (HTML reports)
- All coverage files are ignored by git (see `.gitignore`)

### Building

```bash
# Build all components (Go sidecar + gateway)
make build

# Build only Go components
make build-go

# Build all Docker images
make build-images

# Load built images into Minikube
make load-minikube

# Build and load images into Minikube (one command)
make load-minikube-build
```

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
# Run all linters and formatters (automatically fixes issues when possible)
make lint

# Install pre-commit hooks (runs linters on git commit)
make install-hooks
```

### Integration Test Requirements

The integration tests require Docker to spin up:
- RabbitMQ for message queuing
- Actor runtime (Python) containers
- Actor sidecar (Go) containers
- Gateway (for gateway tests)

These tests validate the complete message flow through the system.

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Deploy full stack to Minikube (requires Minikube running)
make deploy-minikube

# Port-forward Grafana to localhost:3000
make port-forward-grafana
```

### Other Utilities

```bash
# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# See all available commands
make help
```

## Making Changes

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Run tests: `make test`
4. Run linters: `make lint`
5. Commit your changes following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) (pre-commit hooks will run automatically)
6. Push and create a pull request with a conventional commit prefix in the title

### Commit Message Format

This project follows the [Conventional Commits v1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. All PR titles **must** use one of these prefixes:

**Required prefixes:**
- `feat:` - New feature (triggers MINOR version bump)
- `fix:` - Bug fix (triggers PATCH version bump)

**Additional standard prefixes:**
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code formatting (no logic changes)
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring (no functionality change)
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `test:` - Test changes
- `build:` - Build system changes
- `ci:` - CI configuration changes
- `chore:` - Other changes (tooling, maintenance)

**Breaking changes:**
- Add `!` after type/scope: `feat!:` or `feat(api)!:`
- Or include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in commit body

**Examples:**
```
feat(gateway): add support for SQS transport
fix(sidecar): resolve memory leak in message handler
docs: update deployment instructions
chore(deps): upgrade Go to 1.24
ci: add automated release workflow
```

Labels are automatically applied based on PR title prefixes and file paths.

## Release Process

### Automated Release Workflow

Asya uses automated workflows for releases and changelog management:

1. **Draft Releases**: Release-drafter automatically maintains a draft release with categorized changelog based on merged PRs
2. **Docker Images**: When a release is published, Docker images are automatically built and pushed to GitHub Container Registry
3. **Changelog**: CHANGELOG.md is automatically updated via a pull request after release

### Creating a Release

1. **Review the draft release**:
   - Go to [Releases](https://github.com/deliveryhero/asya/releases)
   - Review the auto-generated draft release created by release-drafter
   - Edit the release notes if needed

2. **Publish the release**:
   - Click "Publish release"
   - This triggers the release workflow which:
     - Builds all Docker images (asya-operator, asya-gateway, asya-sidecar, asya-crew, asya-testing)
     - Pushes images to `ghcr.io/deliveryhero/asya-*:VERSION`
     - Tags images as `latest` (for non-prerelease versions)

3. **Docker Images**:
   - Images are published to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
   - Available at: `ghcr.io/deliveryhero/asya-<component>:<version>`
   - Latest stable version tagged as: `ghcr.io/deliveryhero/asya-<component>:latest`

4. **Changelog Update**:
   - After release publication, a PR is automatically created to update CHANGELOG.md
   - Review and merge the PR to keep the changelog in sync

### PR Labels for Release Notes

Labels are **automatically applied** based on your PR title prefix (see Commit Message Format above) and changed file paths. The following labels are used:

**Conventional Commit labels:**
- `feat` - New features (from `feat:` prefix)
- `fix` - Bug fixes (from `fix:` prefix)
- `docs` - Documentation (from `docs:` prefix or `*.md` files)
- `style` - Code formatting (from `style:` prefix)
- `refactor` - Code restructuring (from `refactor:` prefix)
- `perf` - Performance improvements (from `perf:` prefix)
- `test` - Tests (from `test:` prefix or test files)
- `build` - Build changes (from `build:` prefix)
- `ci` - CI changes (from `ci:` prefix or `.github/**` files)
- `chore` - Maintenance (from `chore:` prefix)

**Special labels:**
- `breaking` - Breaking changes (from `type!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:`)
- `deps` - Dependencies (from `go.mod`, `requirements.txt` changes)
- Component labels (`asya-gateway`, `asya-sidecar`, etc.) - Auto-applied based on changed files

You can manually add labels if the autolabeler doesn't catch everything.

### Versioning

The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Major** (X.0.0): Breaking changes (label: `breaking`)
- **Minor** (0.X.0): New features (label: `feat`)
- **Patch** (0.0.X): Bug fixes and other changes (labels: `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`)

Release-drafter automatically suggests the next version based on PR labels.
