    """
    Wait for transport to be ready based on ASYA_TRANSPORT.

    This function determines the transport type from the ASYA_TRANSPORT environment
    variable and calls the appropriate waiting function. This ensures tests work
    with any configured transport without hardcoding transport-specific logic.

    Args:
        required_queues: List of queue names to check. If None, skips queue waiting
                        (only verifies transport connectivity). Tests that need specific
                        queues must explicitly pass them.
        timeout: Maximum time to wait in seconds (default: 30)

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If transport is not ready within timeout
        ConfigurationError: If ASYA_TRANSPORT is not set or unsupported
        ConfigurationError: If required transport-specific env vars are not set

    Example:
        @pytest.fixture(scope="function")
        def gateway_url():
            url = require_env("ASYA_GATEWAY_URL")

            # Wait for gateway health

                try:
                    response = requests.get(f"{url}/health", timeout=2)
                    if response.status_code == 200:
